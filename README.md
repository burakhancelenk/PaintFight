## Game Logic  
The game can be played either in singleplayer mode or in multiplayer mode. Player tries to paint the maximum area until the time is up. Every 15 seconds a new skill is spawned somewhere in the map. So the player can use these skills to gain advantage against others. When time is up, the player who painted the most area wins the game.
